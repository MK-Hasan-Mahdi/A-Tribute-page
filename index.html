            <h4 id="headline">Here is time line of Salahuddin Ayubi life</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phenomenal
                        Attributes</strong>
                    - As a soldier, a ruler, and a human being, Sultan Salahuddin Ayubi was a person of phenomenal
                    attributes.
                    The hero of hundreds of battles was the person who for 20 years braved the storm of the Crusaders
                    and
                    ultimately pushed them back. The world has hardly witnessed a more chivalrous and humane conqueror.
                    His
                    unmatchable battle tactics and gallantry as a soldier, heroic statesmanship and his strength of
                    character won him the respect of even his foes. known for liberating the holy city of Jerusalem from
                    the
                    Crusaders. His chivalrous behavior was noted by Christian chroniclers, especially in the accounts of
                    the
                    siege of Kerak in Moab, and despite being the nemesis of the Crusaders he won the respect of many of
                    them, including Richard the Lionheart; rather than becoming a hated figure in Europe, he became a
                    celebrated example of the principles of chivalry. The Crusades represent the maddest and the longest
                    war
                    in the history of mankind, in which the storm of savage fanaticism of the Christian West burst in
                    all
                    its fury over western Asia. At the height of his power, he ruled over Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia,
                    Hijaz,
                    and Yemen. History is full of his greatest achievements, but here, we are highlighting his two major
                    achievements that are recognized not only by Muslim world but his enemies. One was the Wars against
                    Crusaders and second was, the Capture of Jerusalem.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Early Life</strong> - Saladin was born in Tikrit in present-day Iraq. His personal name was
                    "Yusuf"; "Salah ad-Din" is a laqab, an honorific epithet, meaning "Righteousness of the Faith".[4]
                    His family was most likely of Kurdish ancestry,[5][6][7][8] and had originated from the village of
                    Ajdanakan[6] near the city of Dvin in central Armenia.[9][10] The Rawadiya tribe he hailed from had
                    been partially assimilated into the Arabic-speaking world by this time.[11] In Saladin's era, no
                    scholar had more influence than sheikh Abdul Qadir Gilani, and Saladin was strongly influenced and
                    aided by him and his pupils.[12][13] In 1132, the defeated army of Zengi, Atabeg of Mosul, found
                    their retreat blocked by the Tigris River opposite the fortress of Tikrit, where Saladin's father,
                    Najm ad-Din Ayyub served as the warden. Ayyub provided ferries for the army and gave them refuge in
                    Tikrit. Mujahid al-Din Bihruz, a former Greek slave who had been appointed as the military governor
                    of northern Mesopotamia for his service to the Seljuks, reprimanded Ayyub for giving Zengi refuge
                    and in 1137 banished Ayyub from Tikrit after his brother Asad al-Din Shirkuh killed a friend of
                    Bihruz. According to Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad, Saladin was born on the same night that his family
                    left Tikrit. In 1139, Ayyub and his family moved to Mosul, where Imad ad-Din Zengi acknowledged his
                    debt and appointed Ayyub commander of his fortress in Baalbek. After the death of Zengi in 1146, his
                    son, Nur ad-Din, became the regent of Aleppo and the leader of the Zengids.[14]

                    Saladin, who now lived in Damascus, was reported to have a particular fondness for the city, but
                    information on his early childhood is scarce.[14] About education, Saladin wrote "children are
                    brought up in the way in which their elders were brought up". According to his biographers,
                    Anne-Marie Eddé[15] and al-Wahrani, Saladin was able to answer questions on Euclid, the Almagest,
                    arithmetic, and law, but this was an academic ideal. It was his knowledge of the Qur'an and the
                    "sciences of religion" that linked him to his contemporaries,[16] several sources claim that during
                    his studies he was more interested in religious studies than joining the military.[17] Another
                    factor which may have affected his interest in religion was that, during the First Crusade,
                    Jerusalem was taken by the Christians.[17] In addition to Islam, Saladin had a knowledge of the
                    genealogies, biographies, and histories of the Arabs, as well as the bloodlines of Arabian horses.
                    More significantly, he knew the Hamasah of Abu Tammam by heart.[16] He spoke Kurdish and Arabic.[18]
                </li>
                <li><strong>Early expeditions</strong> - Saladin's military career began under the tutelage of his uncle
                    Asad al-Din Shirkuh, a prominent military commander under Nur ad-Din, the Zengid emir of Damascus
                    and Aleppo and the most influential teacher of Saladin. In 1163, the vizier to the Fatimid caliph
                    al-Adid, Shawar, had been driven out of Egypt by his rival Dirgham, a member of the powerful Banu
                    Ruzzaik tribe. He asked for military backing from Nur ad-Din, who complied and, in 1164, sent
                    Shirkuh to aid Shawar in his expedition against Dirgham. Saladin, at age 26, went along with
                    them.[19] After Shawar was successfully reinstated as vizier, he demanded that Shirkuh withdraw his
                    army from Egypt for a sum of 30,000 gold dinars, but he refused, insisting it was Nur ad-Din's will
                    that he remain. Saladin's role in this expedition was minor, and it is known that he was ordered by
                    Shirkuh to collect stores from Bilbais prior to its siege by a combined force of Crusaders and
                    Shawar's troops.[20]

                    After the sacking of Bilbais, the Crusader-Egyptian force and Shirkuh's army were to engage in the
                    Battle of al-Babein on the desert border of the Nile, just west of Giza. Saladin played a major
                    role, commanding the right-wing of the Zengid army, while a force of Kurds commanded the left, and
                    Shirkuh was stationed in the center. Muslim sources at the time, however, put Saladin in the
                    "baggage of the centre" with orders to lure the enemy into a trap by staging a feigned retreat. The
                    Crusader force enjoyed early success against Shirkuh's troops, but the terrain was too steep and
                    sandy for their horses, and commander Hugh of Caesarea was captured while attacking Saladin's unit.
                    After scattered fighting in little valleys to the south of the main position, the Zengid central
                    force returned to the offensive; Saladin joined in from the rear.[21]

                    The battle ended in a Zengid victory, and Saladin is credited with having helped Shirkuh in one of
                    the "most remarkable victories in recorded history", according to Ibn al-Athir, although more of
                    Shirkuh's men were killed and the battle is considered by most sources as not a total victory.
                    Saladin and Shirkuh moved towards Alexandria where they were welcomed, given money, arms, and
                    provided a base.[22] Faced by a superior Crusader-Egyptian force attempting to besiege the city,
                    Shirkuh split his army. He and the bulk of his force withdrew from Alexandria, while Saladin was
                    left with the task of guarding the city.[23]</li>
                <li><strong>Vizier of Egypt</strong> - Saladin's battles in Egypt
                    Shirkuh was in a power struggle over Egypt with Shawar and Amalric I of Jerusalem in which Shawar
                    requested Amalric's assistance. In 1169, Shawar was reportedly assassinated by Saladin, and Shirkuh
                    died later that year.[24] Following his death, a number of candidates were considered for the role
                    of vizier to al-Adid, most of whom were ethnic Kurds. Their ethnic solidarity came to shape the
                    Ayyubid family's actions in their political career. Saladin and his close associates were wary of
                    Turkish influence. On one occasion Isa al-Hakkari, a Kurdish lieutenant of Saladin, urged a
                    candidate for the viziership, Emir Qutb al-Din al-Hadhbani, to step aside by arguing that "both you
                    and Saladin are Kurds and you will not let the power pass into the hands of the Turks".[25] Nur
                    ad-Din chose a successor for Shirkuh, but al-Adid appointed Saladin to replace Shawar as vizier.[26]
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sultan of Egypt</strong> - According to Imad ad-Din, Nur ad-Din wrote to Saladin in June
                    1171, telling him to reestablish the Abbasid caliphate in Egypt, which Saladin coordinated two
                    months later after additional encouragement by Najm ad-Din al-Khabushani, the Shafi'i faqih, who
                    vehemently opposed Shia rule in the country. Several Egyptian emirs were thus killed, but al-Adid
                    was told that they were killed for rebelling against him. He then fell ill or was poisoned according
                    to one account. While ill, he asked Saladin to pay him a visit to request that he take care of his
                    young children, but Saladin refused, fearing treachery against the Abbasids, and is said to have
                    regretted his action after realizing what al-Adid had wanted.[34] He died on 13 September, and five
                    days later, the Abbasid khutba was pronounced in Cairo and al-Fustat, proclaiming al-Mustadi as
                    caliph.[35]</li>
                <li><strong>Conquest of Damascus</strong> - In the early summer of 1174, Nur ad-Din was mustering an army, sending summons to Mosul, Diyar Bakr, and the Jazira in an apparent preparation of attack against Saladin's Egypt. The Ayyubids held a council upon the revelation of these preparations to discuss the possible threat and Saladin collected his own troops outside Cairo. On 15 May, Nur ad-Din died after falling ill the previous week and his power was handed to his eleven-year-old son as-Salih Ismail al-Malik. His death left Saladin with political independence and in a letter to as-Salih, he promised to "act as a sword" against his enemies and referred to the death of his father as an "earthquake shock".[39]

                    In the wake of Nur ad-Din's death, Saladin faced a difficult decision; he could move his army against the Crusaders from Egypt or wait until invited by as-Salih in Syria to come to his aid and launch a war from there. He could also take it upon himself to annex Syria before it could possibly fall into the hands of a rival, but he feared that attacking a land that formerly belonged to his master—forbidden in the Islamic principles in which he believed—could portray him as hypocritical, thus making him unsuitable for leading the war against the Crusaders. Saladin saw that in order to acquire Syria, he either needed an invitation from as-Salih, or to warn him that potential anarchy could give rise to danger from the Crusaders.[40]
                    
                    When as-Salih was removed to Aleppo in August, Gumushtigin, the emir of the city and a captain of Nur ad-Din's veterans assumed guardianship over him. The emir prepared to unseat all his rivals in Syria and the Jazira, beginning with Damascus. In this emergency, the emir of Damascus appealed to Saif al-Din of Mosul (a cousin of Gumushtigin) for assistance against Aleppo, but he refused, forcing the Syrians to request the aid of Saladin, who complied.[41] Saladin rode across the desert with 700 picked horsemen, passing through al-Kerak then reaching Bosra. According to his own account, was joined by "emirs, soldiers, and Bedouins—the emotions of their hearts to be seen on their faces."[42] On 23 November, he arrived in Damascus amid general acclamation and rested at his father's old home there, until the gates of the Citadel of Damascus,[41] whose commander Raihan initially refused to surrender, were opened to Saladin four days later, after a brief siege by his brother Tughtakin ibn Ayyub.[43] He installed himself in the castle and received the homage and salutations of the inhabitants.[44]</li>
                <li><strong>Campaign against the Assassins</strong> - Saladin had by now agreed truces with his Zengid rivals and the Kingdom of Jerusalem (the latter occurred in the summer of 1175), but faced a threat from the Isma'ili sect known as the Assassins, led by Rashid ad-Din Sinan. Based in the an-Nusayriyah Mountains, they commanded nine fortresses, all built on high elevations. As soon as he dispatched the bulk of his troops to Egypt, Saladin led his army into the an-Nusayriyah range in August 1176. He retreated the same month, after laying waste to the countryside, but failing to conquer any of the forts. Most Muslim historians claim that Saladin's uncle, the governor of Hama, mediated a peace agreement between him and Sinan.[58][59]

                    Saladin had his guards supplied with link lights and had chalk and cinders strewed around his tent outside Masyaf—which he was besieging—to detect any footsteps by the Assassins.[60] According to this version, one night Saladin's guards noticed a spark glowing down the hill of Masyaf and then vanishing among the Ayyubid tents. Presently, Saladin awoke to find a figure leaving the tent. He saw that the lamps were displaced and beside his bed laid hot scones of the shape peculiar to the Assassins with a note at the top pinned by a poisoned dagger. The note threatened that he would be killed if he did not withdraw from his assault. Saladin gave a loud cry, exclaiming that Sinan himself was the figure that had left the tent.[60]
                    
                    Another version claims that Saladin hastily withdrew his troops from Masyaf because they were urgently needed to fend off a Crusader force in the vicinity of Mount Lebanon.[59] In reality, Saladin sought to form an alliance with Sinan and his Assassins, consequently depriving the Crusaders of a potent ally against him.[61] Viewing the expulsion of the Crusaders as a mutual benefit and priority, Saladin and Sinan maintained cooperative relations afterward, the latter dispatching contingents of his forces to bolster Saladin's army in a number of decisive subsequent battlefronts.[62]</li>
                <li><strong>Return to Cairo and forays in Palestine</strong> - After leaving the an-Nusayriyah Mountains, Saladin returned to Damascus and had his Syrian soldiers return home. He left Turan Shah in command of Syria and left for Egypt with only his personal followers, reaching Cairo on 22 September. Having been absent roughly two years, he had much to organize and supervise in Egypt, namely fortifying and reconstructing Cairo. The city walls were repaired and their extensions laid out, while the construction of the Cairo Citadel was commenced.[61] The 280 feet (85 m) deep Bir Yusuf ("Joseph's Well") was built on Saladin's orders. The chief public work he commissioned outside of Cairo was the large bridge at Giza, which was intended to form an outwork of defense against a potential Moorish invasion.[63]

                    Saladin remained in Cairo supervising its improvements, building colleges such as the Madrasa of the Sword Makers and ordering the internal administration of the country. In November 1177, he set out upon a raid into Palestine; the Crusaders had recently forayed into the territory of Damascus, so Saladin saw the truce as no longer worth preserving. The Christians sent a large portion of their army to besiege the fortress of Harim north of Aleppo, so southern Palestine bore few defenders.[63] Saladin found the situation ripe and marched to Ascalon, which he referred to as the "Bride of Syria". William of Tyre recorded that the Ayyubid army consisted of 26,000 soldiers, of which 8,000 were elite forces and 18,000 were black soldiers from Sudan. This army proceeded to raid the countryside, sack Ramla and Lod, and dispersed themselves as far as the Gates of Jerusalem.[64]</li>
                <li><strong>Domestic affairs</strong> - In June 1180, Saladin hosted a reception for Nur al-Din Muhammad, the Artuqid emir of Keyfa, at Geuk Su, in which he presented him and his brother Abu Bakr with gifts, valued at over 100,000 dinars according to Imad al-Din. This was intended to cement an alliance with the Artuqids and to impress other emirs in Mesopotamia and Anatolia. Previously, Saladin offered to mediate relations between Nur al-Din and Kilij Arslan II—the Seljuk sultan of Rûm—after the two came into conflict. The latter demanded that Nur al-Din return the lands given to him as a dowry for marrying his daughter when he received reports that she was being abused and used to gain Seljuk territory. Nur al-Din asked Saladin to mediate the issue, but Arslan refused.[70]

                    After Nur al-Din and Saladin met at Geuk Su, the top Seljuk emir, Ikhtiyar al-Din al-Hasan, confirmed Arslan's submission, after which an agreement was drawn up. Saladin was later enraged when he received a message from Arslan accusing Nur al-Din of more abuses against his daughter. He threatened to attack the city of Malatya, saying, "it is two days march for me and I shall not dismount [my horse] until I am in the city." Alarmed at the threat, the Seljuks pushed for negotiations. Saladin felt that Arslan was correct to care for his daughter, but Nur al-Din had taken refuge with him, and therefore he could not betray his trust. It was finally agreed that Arslan's daughter would be sent away for a year and if Nur al-Din failed to comply, Saladin would move to abandon his support for him.[70]
                    
                    Leaving Farrukh-Shah in charge of Syria, Saladin returned to Cairo at the beginning of 1181. According to Abu Shama, he intended to spend the fast of Ramadan in Egypt and then make the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in the summer. For an unknown reason, he apparently changed his plans regarding the pilgrimage and was seen inspecting the Nile River banks in June. He was again embroiled with the Bedouin; he removed two-thirds of their fiefs to use as compensation for the fief-holders at Fayyum. The Bedouin were also accused of trading with the Crusaders and, consequently, their grain was confiscated and they were forced to migrate westward. Later, Ayyubid warships were waged against Bedouin river pirates, who were plundering the shores of Lake Tanis.[71]
                    
                    In the summer of 1181, Saladin's former palace administrator Qara-Qush led a force to arrest Majd al-Din—a former deputy of Turan-Shah in the Yemeni town of Zabid—while he was entertaining Imad ad-Din al-Ishfahani at his estate in Cairo. Saladin's intimates accused Majd al-Din of misappropriating the revenues of Zabid, but Saladin himself believed there was no evidence to back the allegations. He had Majd al-Din released in return for a payment of 80,000 dinars. In addition, other sums were to be paid to Saladin's brothers al-Adil and Taj al-Muluk Buri. The controversial detainment of Majd al-Din was a part of the larger discontent associated with the aftermath of Turan-Shah's departure from Yemen. Although his deputies continued to send him revenues from the province, centralized authority was lacking and an internal quarrel arose between Izz al-Din Uthman of Aden and Hittan of Zabid. Saladin wrote in a letter to al-Adil: "this Yemen is a treasure house ... We conquered it, but up to this day we have had no return and no advantage from it. There have been only innumerable expenses, the sending out of troops ... and expectations which did not produce what was hoped for in the end."[72]</li>
                <li><strong>Death</strong> - Saladin died of a fever on 4 March 1193, at Damascus, not long after King Richard's departure. In Saladin’s possession at the time of his death were one piece of gold and forty pieces of silver.[119] He had given away his great wealth to his poor subjects, leaving nothing to pay for his funeral.[120] He was buried in a mausoleum in the garden outside the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria. Originally the tomb was part of a complex which also included a school, Madrassah al-Aziziah, of which little remains except a few columns and an internal arch.[121] Seven centuries later, Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany donated a new marble sarcophagus to the mausoleum. However, the original sarcophagus was not replaced; instead, the mausoleum, which is open to visitors, now has two sarcophagi: the marble one placed on the side and the original wooden one, which covers Saladin's tomb.</li>
